# HIIT the Deck

A fitness card game, developed for mobile with Expo. I started this project in early 2023, based on an idea by [Jim Goza](https://jimsgym.fit/).

## Roadmap

It is August 2025, and I want to resurrect the old codebase and turn it into a publishable mobile app. At the moment, the old codebase will only run using Node 16. Many dependencies are outdated/deprecated, and there doesn't seem to be a straightforward way to update anything. There's work to do.

I am starting with a fresh Expo project. The old state logic (Redux) should still be useable, so I will pull it into this new repo and rewrite it in TypeScript. My best bet is to just start over again with the UI and leverage Expo's new routing paradigm.

- Rewrite existing game logic in TypeScript
- Rewrite existing UI with modern libraries
- ...?
